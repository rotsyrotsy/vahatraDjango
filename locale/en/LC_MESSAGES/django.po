"This association evolved in a natural manner from a WWF-Madagascar project "
"known as “The Ecology Training Program” (ETP), for which the principal "
"philosophy was the development and reinforcement of capacity for Malagasy "
"nationals in ecology and conservation biology. The ETP was initiated in 1991 "
"to advance young Malagasy graduate students working in these domains.  The "
"program has also had a major positive impact on the expansion of knowledge "
"of the island’s unique and highly endemic biota.  It is not an exaggeration "
"to state that the ETP was a driving force for the development of human "
"capital on Madagascar in the fields of evolutionary biology and on the "
"ecology and diversity of the Malagasy animal fauna. Further, with the "
"availability of more scientifically viable data on the island’s biota, "
"decisions associated with conservation, including the identification of new "
"protected areas, are well supported; the ETP played a critical role  in this "
"regard. "

"In 2007, at the moment that Vahatra became independent of WWF, the ETP had "
"helped advance over 75 Malagasy graduate students earning higher degrees "
"within the national university system in the fields of zoology, ecology or "
"conservation biology and more than 250 students being trained in "
"conservation science in the form of university courses or field schools. In "
"addition, data obtain during ETP field inventories at over 400 sites  "
"resulted in the discovery of nearly 50 new species of birds, mammals, "
"reptiles, and amphibians, and the publication of nearly 500 scientific "
"articles. This work was critical in the prioritization of conservation "
"strategies associated with the island’s protected area system."

"important contributions to biology and the future of conservation efforts of "

"To ensure the continuity of this success, we believed that the next logical "

"the  Association Vahatra in September 2007. A group of former ETP Ph.D. "
"graduates, who are now part of the Malagasy university system, direct "
"Vahatra, which in part continues the basic mandates of the ETP -- to advance "
"Malagasy conservation biologists and research on the island’s biota.  "

"Madagascar a journal was produced and entitled, Naturaliste Malgache. This "

"world, rather than only being on the receiving end. We consider this a very "
"important professional step for the Malagasy scientific community. "
